The association purpose is to design a robotic sailboat to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
The project take part into an interschool competition, so the code found on this repository doesn't belong to the drone itself,
but to an educational simulator build by myself. The objective of the simulator is to trained new comers in the association, 
and to get a better insight of the drone need for electronic component and programing.
